Thanks to its catchy theme song (which can get stuck in your head faster than “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baby Shark</a>”), lovable characters, and genuinely heartwarming plot, this show about a 6-year-old Blue Heeler pup named Bluey and her adventures with her dad – Bandit, her sister – Bingo, and her mom – Chilli, can do no wrong.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>After three magical seasons on ABC Kids, the sister network of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluey</a> has churned out a total of 151 episodes as of this writing. Rumors that the show was coming to an end after its 3rd season were put to rest when the production company that makes the program — Ludo — called the rumors “completely untrue,” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>Now that season 4 has been confirmed, it’s time to board the Dad-train and&nbsp;get those speculation juices flowing because I speak for everyone (including the dogs whose parents put on Bluey while they are away) when I say there’s no such thing as too much Bluey.</p><h2 id=h-will-season-4-of-bluey-be-the-last data-injectable=false>Will season 4 of Bluey be the last?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some of you have spotted some online speculation on the future of <a href=#>#Bluey</a>. We absolutely love the show and there are no plans to end it. The community of fans around the world continue to blow us away and if we ever had an update on Bluey’s future you’d hear it from us first. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PmdLjpmjvj</a></p>— Official Bluey TV (@OfficialBlueyTV) <a href=#>May 4, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>All good things must come to an end eventually, and that includes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluey</a>. While we hope it becomes a decades-long hit that churns out one heartwarming episode after the last, the reality is that the children who voice the young characters will eventually age out of their roles. Whether new child actors will be brought in to voice the character in their place is a hot-button topic the show has not publicly addressed yet.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>In 2022, the show relieved our worries when it was confirmed that there are no plans for it to end anytime time soon. When the fateful day does eventually arrive, we will hear it from them first. I think I speak for almost everyone when I say thank goodness for that.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When might season 4 be released?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluey</a> premieres its episodes on ABC Kids first and then releases them on Disney Plus thereafter. This means season 4 will be available to Australian residents before the wider public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>There is no official release date for season 4 yet, but it is speculated that the 4th season will drop sometime in 2024. By my estimation, that’ll be mid- to late- 2024.</p><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=884 data-injectable=true>Season 3 was split into four parts, as opposed to the previous seasons which were only split into two. Typically, part one and part two air six months apart, but season 3 aired parts two and three nearly eight months apart, ending with episode 37 “The Decider” on June 23, 2022, and resuming with episode 38, “Cubby” on April 9, 2023. The last episode of part three, “Cricket” aired on June 11, 2023, but the final three episodes of part four still do not have a release date as of this writing.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>If the past is any indication of the future, part four of season 3 will likely premiere in December 2023 or early 2024. Of course, that means season 4 is, at minimum, six months down the road from that in July or August of 2024. Any Disney Plus episodes will likely premiere a couple of months after that.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-s-been-cast-in-bluey-season-4 data-injectable=false>Who’s been cast in Bluey season 4?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>Like its release date, the cast and characters of season 4 have not been announced yet, but don’t worry, we will update you as soon as it is. The main cast — Bluey, Bingo, Bandit, and Chilli — will undoubtedly return, but any details beyond that remain speculative. David McCormack and Melanie Zanetti — who voice Bandit and Chilli respectively — are also anticipated to return, as are the child actors who voice <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluey and Bingo</a>; however, they are not credited due to their young age so we don’t know their names. We do know that their parents are adults who work on the show, though. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>It’s not far-fetched to assume we’ll see some of our favorite reoccurring characters such as Grandad, Nana, Aunt Trixie, Uncle Stripe, Muffin, Rusty, Calypso, Chloe, and — fingers crossed — Jean Luc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-plot-for-bluey-season-4 data-injectable=false>What is the plot for Bluey season 4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bluey.jpg><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Like much else at this point, the plot for Bluey season 4 is as much under wraps as its release date. The show’s creator, Joe Brumm — who also writes every episode — says each one “generally starts from something I’m noticing in my kids’ life or my wife and I’s life that just keeps coming up,” per his interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Most episodes involve a game between Bingo and Bluey (and often Bandit), so we can expect more of that. Since kids are a well of untapped imagination, there’s probably been no shortage of wild pastimes going on under the Brumm family roof; soon, the same will be said for the Heeler household.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=76 data-injectable=false>Bluey seasons 1 through 3 are currently available to stream on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjuNSesGarlZbAsLqMbWSrnZyarrSxjLCgp5yfrHqktMCrmJyslafAbq3NnWSmp6KafA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./carlo-marks-net-worth-80669.html>&#171;&nbsp;Carlo Marks Net Worth</a>
