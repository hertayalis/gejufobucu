has been accused of sexually assaulting his pupils while teaching in Florida</p><p><span>The retired teacher whose brutal murder rocked a picture-perfect town designed by Disney has been accused of having a history of sexually abusing his male pupils.</span></p><p><span>The violent murder of life-long Disney fan Matteo Patrick Giovanditto, who was found bludgeoned to death at his home in Celebration, Florida, U.S., in 2010, was the first in the history of the nostalgic homage to small-town America built south of Disney World.<br></span></p><p><span>David-Israel Zenon Murillo, the homeless man who is set to face trial for the murder of the 58-year-old, told police he flew into a rage after Mr Giovanditto tried to sexually assault him.<br></span></p><p><span>Now a number of former pupils have claimed the 'charismatic' teacher know as Mr G - who was said to be known for rewarding his pupils' achievements in the classroom with weekend trips to Disney World and sleepovers at his house - molested them during the 1980s.</span></p><p><span>An anonymous mother told</span><span> </span><a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span>The Daily Beast</span></a><span> that Giovanditto - who she has described as a 'cunning paedophile predator' - developed a close relationship with her 10-year-old son when she enrolled him in a summer camp at the Crossroads Academy in Florida, while Giovanditto was head teacher.</span></p><p><span>The single mother said the teacher appeared to take her son under his wing - even treating him to trips abroad to countries including Mexico, Japan and China - until the boy suddenly cut all ties with Giovanditto at the age of 14. She claims she later learned her son's 'mentor' had been sexually abusing him for years.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/12/article-2201985-14F973AD000005DC-661_634x419.jpg height=419 width=634 alt="Accused: David-Israel Zenon Murillo claims Giovanditto gave him a beer laced with drugs then tried to have sex with him" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Accused: David-Israel Zenon Murillo claims Giovanditto gave him a beer laced with drugs then tried to have sex with him</p><p><span>A former pupil at Lehrman Day School, a private Jewish school where Giovanditto began teaching after relocating to Florida from Arizona in 1981, also told the news website he had had 'sexual contact' with his teacher during the mid-1980s.</span></p><p><span>Describing himself as a 'pretty quiet kid', the former student said the teacher had taken an interest in him and 'pushed him to excel', and that the pair quickly began spending time together outside of school hours. Named only as 'D', the man said the sexual contact between himself and his teacher stopped only when his mother suddenly banned him from seeing Giovanditto outside of the classroom.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/02/article-1335057-0C5353A6000005DC-774_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Murder in Disney town: Idyllic community built by Disney...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/07/article-1336364-0C6184AA000005DC-540_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>'He got what he deserved': Axe-wielding homeless man...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p><span>He claimed it was only with hindsight he realised what had taken place amounted to abuse.</span></p><p><span>He said: 'It had not really occurred to me.
